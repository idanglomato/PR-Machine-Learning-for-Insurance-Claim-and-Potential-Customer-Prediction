## Machine Learning for Insurance Claim and Potential Customer Prediction

### Description
The insurance company called "Sure Tomorrow" wants to address some issues with the help of machine learning. You have been asked to evaluate the possibilities.

### Objectives
The objectives for this research are:
1. Find clients who are similar to a specific client's criteria. This task will facilitate the company's marketing efforts.
2. Predict whether new clients are likely to file an insurance claim. Is the model's prediction better than that of the dummy model?
3. Predict the potential amount of insurance claims that new clients may receive using a linear regression model.
4. Protect clients' personal data without compromising the model from the previous tasks.
